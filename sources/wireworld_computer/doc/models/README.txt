This directory contains models related to Wireworld Computer and that can be simulated in Wireworld simulator

Parts directory contains some models of Wireworld Computers parts used during the reverse engineering of the design

wireworld_computer.txt is an empty design of Wireworld Computer, meaning that everything needed to run Wireworld Computer is there but all registers are empty
wireworld_computer.xml is the generic configuration file of Wireworld Computer. It defines which cells can be configured to set the content of Wireworld Computer registers
wireworld_computer.conf is the configuration file of Wireworld Computer. It defines the value of each bit of each register of Wireworld computer. It can be generated from software code using my functionnal simulator of Wireworld Computer
wireworld_computer.ref is the the wireworld computer design generated from a screenshot of Java Applet simulating wireworld computer on Quinapalus website
